1)<!DocType> is not an HTML tag — it’s an instruction to the browser.

-->It tells the browser which version of HTML the page is using.

2)What happens if you don’t use it?

--> CSS layouts may break

--> Margins, padding, box model may behave differently

--> Page may look different in different browsers 😵

3)Real-life example 🧠

--> Think of <!DOCTYPE> like a rule book 📘

--> With rule book → everyone plays correctly

--> Without rule book → players follow old rules 😅

Always start HTML with <!DOCTYPE html> to avoid layout bugs and browser issues.

====================================================================================
<form></form> tag
he <form> tag is used to collect user input and send it to a server.

1)What problem does <form> solve?

Without <form>:
================
---> Inputs are just text boxes

---> Browser doesn’t know what to send

---> Browser doesn’t know where to send

With <form>:
============
---> Browser groups inputs 📦

---> Sends data in a proper format

---> Can submit data automatically

with form collect the  group of input tag data send to server automaticaly with help of URL
Without form we can not group data can not send to server automaticaly

<label></label>
================
1)a piece of paper, etc. that is fixed to something and which gives information about it.
2)Screen reader users  (will read out loud the label, when the user is focused on the element)

3)Users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as checkboxes) - because 
                 when a user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the input (this increases the hit area). 

4)Why clicking the label does NOT select the radio button?
Because for in <label> is NOT connected to any input id.
