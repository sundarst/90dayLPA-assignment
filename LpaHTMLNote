1)<!DocType> is not an HTML tag — it’s an instruction to the browser.

-->It tells the browser which version of HTML the page is using.

2)What happens if you don’t use it?

--> CSS layouts may break

--> Margins, padding, box model may behave differently

--> Page may look different in different browsers 😵

3)Real-life example 🧠

--> Think of <!DOCTYPE> like a rule book 📘

--> With rule book → everyone plays correctly

--> Without rule book → players follow old rules 😅

Always start HTML with <!DOCTYPE html> to avoid layout bugs and browser issues.

====================================================================================
<form></form> tag
he <form> tag is used to collect user input and send it to a server.

1)What problem does <form> solve?

Without <form>:
================
---> Inputs are just text boxes

---> Browser doesn’t know what to send

---> Browser doesn’t know where to send

With <form>:
============
---> Browser groups inputs 📦

---> Sends data in a proper format

---> Can submit data automatically

with form collect the  group of input tag data send to server automaticaly with help of URL
Without form we can not group data can not send to server automaticaly

<label></label> and radio button
==================================
1)a piece of paper, etc. that is fixed to something and which gives information about it.
2)Screen reader users  (will read out loud the label, when the user is focused on the element)

3)Users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as checkboxes) - because 
                 when a user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the input (this increases the hit area). 

4)Why clicking the label does NOT select the radio button?
Because for in <label> is NOT connected to any input id.

checkBox
============
Checkboxes are used to let a user select one or more options of a limited number of choices.

============================
<textarea></textarea>
If we use form to submit, why is name attribute needed?
--->When a form is submitted, only elements with a name attribute are sent to the server.

👉 If there is no name, the browser will NOT send that field’s data.

<form action="/save" method="post">
    <textarea name="comment"></textarea>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

String comment = request.getParameter("comment");

*)id="comment" → connects label

*)name="comment" → sends data to backend

 ---> a multi-line text input control.
 ---> The size of a text area is specified by the cols and rows attributes (or with CSS).
 ---> A text area can hold an unlimited number of characters, and the text renders in a fixed-width font 
 
 ============================
 <select></select>
 The <select> element is used to create a drop-down list.
 , to collect user input.
If we use form to submit, why is name attribute needed?
--->When a form is submitted, only elements with a name attribute are sent to the server.

👉 If there is no name, the browser will NOT send that field’s data.

The <option> tags inside the <select> element define the available options in the drop-down list.

The id attribute is needed to associate the drop-down list with a label.

==============================
What are Semantic Elements?
---> A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

---> Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <img>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> 
to indicate navigation, header, and footer

==============
<video></video>
The <video> tag is used to embed video content in a document, such as a movie clip or other video streams.

🔹 Is type compulsory?

❌ Not strictly required
✅ But recommended (best practice)

If you remove type, browser will still try to detect format from file,
but giving type makes loading faster and more efficient.
